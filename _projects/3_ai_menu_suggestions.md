## Why

I am in my weight loss journey. I am trying to eat healthier. I am also trying to eat out less. I still have to maintain my social life, and whenever i meet friends and family, eventually it boils down to eating out somewhere or ordering in. So I made this tool to help me suggest what to eat at a restaurant based on my diet preferences.
<br />

The idea is, once the restaurant is decided, I scan the menu. How many calories can i afford to eat, how many have i already eaten today, are there protein options that i might like, etc. It is a task. With these LLM advancements, they are more than capable of doing this task given they have the menu.

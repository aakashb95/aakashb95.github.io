## Why

I am paying rent, and was wondering if I should upgrade to a bigger home. Then I compared rent at the new place I was looking at, which made me wonder if I should buy a home instead of renting, if the loan EMI is less than or equal to the rent.

<br/>

Another thing I wanted to see was, how much should I earn to be able to afford a home of a particular price.

## How

Frontend is NextJS, written with the help of Claude 3.5 Sonnet, deployed on Vercel.

## Scope of Improvement

- It does not consider growing income.
- It does not consider the increase in home value.
- It does not consider the maintenance costs.
- It does not consider the opportunity cost of buying a home.

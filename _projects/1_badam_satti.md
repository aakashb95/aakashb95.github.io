[Badam Satti](https://badam7.aakashb.xyz/) is a classic card game designed for friends and family to enjoy together. It is best played in person and with more than 4 players, but since not everyone is physically around, I decided to vibe code this into an online multiplayer game.
<br>

## Game Features

Built with React + Node.js + Socket.io featuring: <br/>

- âœ¨ 2-11 players per room
- ðŸ“± Mobile-first responsive design
- ðŸ”— Instant room sharing via links
- âš¡ Real-time multiplayer sync
- ðŸŽ® Auto-play system (no more waiting!)

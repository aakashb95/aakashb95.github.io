## Why

IRCTC website is a pain to use. Cancellation is a different pain altogether. You need to click cancel and only then do you see the charges.
They do have a link that explains the charges but it is a pdf with conditions based on classes, time of departure and cancellation, etc.
So I made this to calculate the charges for me.

## How

Frontend is NextJS, written with the help of Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
Backend is a simple Node JS server that speaks to one of the RapidAPI IRCTC endpoints.
